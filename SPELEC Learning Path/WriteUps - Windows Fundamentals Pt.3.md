# **Firewall & Network Protection**

A **firewall** monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic.

It helps prevent **unauthorized access** to a system.

Command to open Windows Firewall:

WF.msc  
---

## **Firewall Profiles**

| Profile | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Domain** | Used when connected to a corporate network |
| **Private** | Used for trusted networks such as home Wi-Fi |
| **Public** | Used for untrusted networks like airports |

---

### **Example Scenario**

If connected to **airport Wi-Fi**, the firewall profile should be:

Public Network

This profile has the **strictest security settings**.

---

### **Tip**

Always use the **Public profile** when connecting to unfamiliar networks.

---

### **Quick Summary**

* Firewalls protect systems from **unauthorized network access**.

* Windows uses **three network profiles**.

* Public networks require **strict security controls**.

---

# **App & Browser Control**

Windows includes **Microsoft Defender SmartScreen**, which protects users from:

* Phishing websites

* Malicious downloads

* Unsafe applications

SmartScreen analyzes files and websites to determine **potential risks**.

---

## **Exploit Protection**

Exploit protection helps defend against:

* Memory corruption attacks

* Application vulnerabilities

* Code injection attacks

This feature is built directly into Windows.

---

### **Quick Summary**

* SmartScreen protects against **malicious websites and downloads**.

---

# **Device Security**

Device Security includes **hardware-based protection features**.

---

## **Core Isolation**

Core Isolation uses **virtualization-based security** to protect sensitive parts of the operating system.

### **Memory Integrity**

This feature prevents attackers from inserting **malicious code into protected processes**.

---

## **Trusted Platform Module (TPM)**

**TPM (Trusted Platform Module)** is a hardware-based security chip that performs cryptographic operations.

Functions include:

* Secure encryption key storage

* System integrity verification
