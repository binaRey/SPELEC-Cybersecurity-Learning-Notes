🛡️ SPELEC – Cybersecurity Learning Notes

This repository is a personal collection of notes, labs, and hands-on practice created while learning the fundamentals of ethical hacking and cybersecurity.

My learning journey is currently focused on:

TryHackMe (annual subscription) for practical, hands-on labs

Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing Guide by Rafay Baloch for theoretical foundations

The goal of this repository is to:

Document my learning progress

Reinforce concepts through notes and exercises

Build a structured reference for future review

Demonstrate consistent growth in cybersecurity fundamentals
